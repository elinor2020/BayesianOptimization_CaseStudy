# BayesianOptimization_CaseStudy:
Bayesian optimization works by constructing a posterior distribution of functions (Gaussian process) that best describes the function to be optimized. As the number of observations grows, the posterior distribution improves, and the algorithm becomes more certain of which regions in parameter space are worth exploring and which are not.
